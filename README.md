## Description

The goal for this challenge was to create an application that can be used to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in a company. When the application is started, several options are presented so a formatted table is shown with the different informations requested. Some of the options require data to be entered to update or add additional informations. Watch this [demo](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/JMHUsfXuXFq0dKwNxeL9) to see the employee database.
